- Fixed issue with YAML configuration files containing (possibly) unexpected template model parameters - which resulted in device type failures. Model retrospection (attribute lookup) is now used to skip unexpected attributes, creating template components containing only expected attributes.
- Fixed issue with creating `power-outlets` and `front-ports` templates without creating proper references to corresponding `power_port` and `rear_port` templates
