# Installing the App in Nautobot

Here you will find detailed instructions on how to **install** and **configure** the App within your Nautobot environment.

## Prerequisites

- The plugin is compatible with Nautobot 1.6.0 and higher.
- Databases supported: PostgreSQL, MySQL

!!! note
    Please check the [dedicated page](compatibility_matrix.md) for a full compatibility matrix and the deprecation policy.

## Install Guide

!!! note
    Plugins can be installed manually or using Python's `pip`. See the [nautobot documentation](https://nautobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/#install-the-package) for more details. The pip package name for this plugin is [`nautobot-welcome-wizard`](https://pypi.org/project/nautobot-welcome-wizard/).

The plugin is available as a Python package via PyPI and can be installed with `pip`:

```shell
pip install nautobot-welcome-wizard
```

To ensure Welcome Wizard is automatically re-installed during future upgrades, create a file named `local_requirements.txt` (if not already existing) in the Nautobot root directory (alongside `requirements.txt`) and list the `nautobot-welcome-wizard` package:

```shell
echo nautobot-welcome-wizard >> local_requirements.txt
```

Once installed, the plugin needs to be enabled in your Nautobot configuration. The following block of code below shows the additional configuration required to be added to your `nautobot_config.py` file:

- Append `"welcome_wizard"` to the `PLUGINS` list.
- Append the `"welcome_wizard"` dictionary to the `PLUGINS_CONFIG` dictionary and override any defaults.

```python
# In your nautobot_config.py
PLUGINS = ["welcome_wizard"]

# PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
#   "welcome_wizard": {
#     "enable_devicetype-library": True,
#     "enable_welcome_banner": True,
#   }
# }
```

Once the Nautobot configuration is updated, run the Post Upgrade command (`nautobot-server post_upgrade`) to run migrations and clear any cache:

```shell
nautobot-server post_upgrade
```

Then restart (if necessary) the Nautobot services which may include:

- Nautobot
- Nautobot Workers
- Nautobot Scheduler

```shell
sudo systemctl restart nautobot nautobot-worker nautobot-scheduler
```

## App Configuration

The plugin behavior can be controlled with the following list of settings:

| Key     | Example | Default | Description                          |
| ------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `enable_devicetype-library` | `True` | `True` | If enabled, the [device type](https://github.com/netbox-community/devicetype-library) git repository will be automatically added for you. |
| `enable_welcome_banner` | `True` | `True` | If enabled, the Welcome Wizard banner will display on the home screen for authenticated users. |
